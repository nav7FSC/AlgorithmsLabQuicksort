## Overview
This project implements the Quicksort algorithm in Java, a highly efficient sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements in an array. The implementation includes features such as array display functionality, element swapping, and both standard and randomized versions of the Quicksort algorithm.

## Features
- **Array Display**: Displays all elements of an integer array in a single line, separated by spaces.
- **Element Swapping**: Provides functionality to swap two elements in an array.
- **Partitioning**: Implements partitioning of the array around a pivot element to aid in sorting.
- **Standard and Randomized Quicksort**: Uses recursion for sorting, with the option to use a randomly selected pivot to enhance performance.
- **Comparison of Sorting Results**: Compares the sorted results of an integer array and an `ArrayList` to ensure they match.

## Usage
The program generates a random array of integers within the range of 0 to 999, displays the unsorted array, sorts it using the Quicksort algorithm, and then shows the sorted array. It also generates a second collection, comparing results between the integer array and an `ArrayList` to verify that both collections contain the same sorted data.

## Output Separators
For improved readability, each output section is separated by a line of dashes:
```java
System.out.println("---------");

## Example Output

Unsorted array:
10 80 30 90 40 50 70 
Sorted array:
10 30 40 50 70 80 90 
---------
Random array before sorting:
918 612 22 453 326 ...
Random array after sorting:
22 76 137 167 326 ...
---------
The arrays are the same.
---------
Randomized quicksort result:
22 76 137 167 326 ...
---------

## How to Run the Program
